# X-Team NN Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

The problem we are looking to solve is that it can be hard to seperate students into groups. Often, when seperating students into groups the grouping can become very uneven. Students with low GPA's can be paired with other students with low GPA's which can lead to some groups struggling. Our program looks to solve this by grouping students based on there GPA's. The program will take in a file with names and gpa's. The user will then specify the size of the groups and the program will create the GPA balanced groups.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)



2. Output: The program will output a file with a list of each team and each group member in each team. The averaged GPA of the group will also be listed with each group.




3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Users will run the program from the console.

Interface on example run of program: 

||||X Team Group Maker||||
Loaded XXX people.         
How many people per group? 
<UserInput>                 
Separated into XXX groups.  
Output to file successful.
||||||||||||||||||||||||||

5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
