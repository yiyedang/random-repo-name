# X-Team 78 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Read the project details, then divide and distribute workload fairly and based on strengths if at all possible.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Discuss with the group and make an outline/deadlines to make sure we are staying on track to finish the tasks on time.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will communicate difficulties with the agreed upon group chat. We will make sure to take all questions fairly and not let anyone get behind due to any questions.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will check the progress frequently and send text reminders in the group chat on time.

## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
